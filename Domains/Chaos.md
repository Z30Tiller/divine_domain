**Chaos Minion**

As a Bonus Action, select one creature. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC is 10 + your Charisma modifier). On a save they are immune from being controlled for a month. On a fail, they become your loyal minion, willing to do anything you ask of them. However, every time you command them to do something they make another Wisdom saving throw with Disadvantage. If they fail, they can not resist your control until they complete a Long Rest. You can control a number of creatures equal to 10 x your Divine Level. Your control can be removed by similar means to Remove Curse. (**Consequence**: Every time you issue a command you take 2d12 damage. This damage can not be resisted.)
