A creature who is your Champion gains the following benefits:

- +3 to AC.
- All weapon attacks are magical and can crit on an 18, 19, or 20.
- As a Bonus Action they can call upon you to intervene, allowing you to either teleport to the closest free space next to them, or use Channel Divine Energy with them as the source.
- As an Action the creature can communicate with you, and can allow you to see and hear everything they can.
- The Champion gains a relic representing your domain. This relic can be either a weapon, armor, or an artifact. You can choose to either make something the Champion already owns as the relic, or create a new item (work with the DM to decide the stats and abilities of this relic).

### DIVINE POLYMORPH
At 18th level you are able to cast True Polymorph on yourself without taking up a Spell Slot. Casting this takes up both your Action and Bonus Action for the turn. You do not need to wait the full hour for the transformation to be permanent, and casting True Polymorph this way does not require Concentration. Any gear on your person does not meld into your new form. Your new form can be any creature ignoring Challenge Rating and Level, and can be any non-magical object of any size.

### POCKET DIMENSION
At 20th level you can channel enough Divine Energy to create your own Pocket Dimension. This Dimension will take the shape and form of your choosing, and only can be opened by you.

The Gateway takes the form of whatever you wish, and stays open for as long as you want. While in your Pocket Dimension you can create a Gateway to anywhere that you have previously been.
