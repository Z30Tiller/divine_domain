### CLASS FEATURES

### CHANNEL DIVINE ENERGY
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel your own Divine Energy. Below is a list of abilities you can do through Channeling your Energy, but each comes with a **Consequence** as your mortal form tries to channel the energy. Your Divine Domain also grants you one additional ability. You can Channel Divine Energy as many times equal to your Divine level per long rest.

As a Bonus Action you can activate one of the following abilities:

- **Divine Domain Ability**: See your Divine Domain for further details on this.

- **Divine Healing**: By touching another creature you can heal them for a d10 per Divine level, restore a lost limb, or remove diseases from the creature. (**Consequence**: You take a d4 per Divine level when using this ability.)

- **Divine Command**: Your voice booms as if coming from the sky, and all creatures within 120 feet can hear it. You can select a number of creatures up to half your Divine level (rounded up) that can hear your voice. They must make a Wisdom Saving Throw (DC is 10 + your Charisma modifier) or obey one command from you. The effect ends once the command has been completed, 24 hours has passed, or the creature is unconscious. (**Consequence**: After doing this you have disadvantage on Charisma saving throws and creatures attacking you have advantage. This effect lasts for 10 minutes or until you take a short or long rest.)

- **Divine Wrath**: Through anger you channel your Divine Energy to strengthen and fortify your body. You gain +2 to your AC, and have +3 to all attack rolls. As a Bonus Action you can give yourself advantage on all attack rolls made that turn. This ability lasts for 1 minute. (**Consequence**: You have disadvantage on Wisdom, Dexterity, and Intelligence saving throws. Creatures attacking you have advantage. You also take an additional 1d6 damage from any magical source.)

- **Divine Spell**: You gain the ability to cast a single spell. The spell can be any spell from the Player's Handbook as long as it is equal to or less than the highest spell level on the following chart:

  | Divine Level | Max Spell Level |
  |--------------|-----------------|
  | 1            | 1               |
  | 3            | 2               |
  | 5            | 3               |
  | 7            | 4               |
  | 11           | 5               |
  | 13           | 6               |
  | 15           | 7               |
  | 17           | 8               |
  | 19           | 9               |

  You do not have to pay for the material cost of these spells, but must follow all other rules. When deciding what spell level you can cast the spell at, you can choose up to the highest spell level you have access to at your Divine level.

  **Spell save DC** = 10 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Wisdom modifier

  **Spell attack modifier** = your Proficiency Bonus + your Wisdom modifier

### DIVINE CHAMPION
At 18th level you can choose a Champion to fight and act on your behalf. As an Action, select one creature that you can touch. You mark them with your Domain’s Symbol as they are filled with your Divine Energy. If you had a Champion, the new creature becomes your new Champion and the previous creature loses all benefits from being your Champion. The Creature you touch cannot be a Champion of a different Domain, or have a level in the Divine Class. You can only select a Champion once per long rest.

A creature who is your Champion gains the following benefits:

- +2 to AC.
- All weapon attacks made with the Champion's relic are magical and can crit on a 19 or 20.
- As a Bonus Action they can call upon you to intervene, allowing you to either teleport to the closest free space next to them, or use Channel Divine Energy with them as the source.
- As an Action the creature can communicate with you, and can allow you to see and hear everything they can.
- The Champion gains a relic representing your domain. This relic can be either a weapon, armor, or an artifact. You can choose to either make something the Champion already owns as the relic, or create a new item (work with the DM to decide the stats and abilities of this relic).

### DIVINE POLYMORPH
At 18th level you are able to cast True Polymorph on yourself without taking up a Spell Slot. Casting this takes up both your Action and Bonus Action for the turn. You do not need to wait the full hour for the transformation to be permanent, and casting True Polymorph this way does not require Concentration. Any gear on your person does not meld into your new form. Your new form can be any creature ignoring Challenge Rating and Level, and can be any non-magical object of any size.
